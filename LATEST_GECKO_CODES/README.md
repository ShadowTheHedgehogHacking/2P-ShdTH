## Latest gecko codes

## USERS
You will only care about GUPE8P.ini in the root of this folder. Ignore the rest

## DEVELOPERS
Note we have hit the Gecko limit, so `development_only` is only used for verifying codes.
Many need to be disabled to test new codes, keep this in mind if writing more codes.

`2PMod_MCM_Format.txt` and `settings.py` are for MeleeCodeManager v4.3 by DRGN
Set the ISO to be read as v1.06 NTSC to properly edit the DOL. Note the stack shift code is REQUIRED for testing!
