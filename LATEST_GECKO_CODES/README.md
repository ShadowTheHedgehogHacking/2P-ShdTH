## Latest gecko codes
`other_testin_codes.txt` are codes no longer in use or not related specifically to 2P mod (SuperShadow v0.4 for example).

`GUPE8P.ini` is for development

Place it in Dolphin\User\GameSettings

Note we have hit the Gecko limit, so this is only used for verifying codes. Many need to be disabled to test new codes.
