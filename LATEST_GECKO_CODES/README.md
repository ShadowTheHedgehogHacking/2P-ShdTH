## Latest gecko codes

## DEVELOPERS
Note we have hit the Gecko limit, so `development_only` is only used for verifying codes.
Many need to be disabled to test new codes, keep this in mind if writing more codes.

`2PMod_MCM_Format.txt` and `settings.py` are for MeleeCodeManager v4.2 by DRGN
Set the ISO to be read as v1.06 NTSC to properly edit the DOL. Note the stack shift code is REQUIRED for testing!

## END USERS
The small GUPE8P.ini is the correct one to use (the other codes are embedded in the DOL)
