## Latest gecko codes

## USERS
You will only care about GUPE8P.ini in the root of this folder. Ignore the rest


If you are going to use Nintendont / Play on real hardware use:
https://github.com/CLF78/CodeManager2

And open the GUPE8P.ini to generate a GCT

As of 2021-06-13 you need a special build of Nintendont to work with 2P Mod v2.0+

## DEVELOPERS
Note we have hit the Gecko limit, so `development_only` is only used for verifying codes.
Many need to be disabled to test new codes, keep this in mind if writing more codes.

`2PMod_MCM_Format.txt` and `settings.py` are for MeleeCodeManager v4.3 by DRGN
Set the ISO to be read as v1.06 NTSC to properly edit the DOL. Note the stack shift code is REQUIRED for testing!
