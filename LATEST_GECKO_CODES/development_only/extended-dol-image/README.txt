This is old, we don't need an extended dol anymore now that we can use:

Shadow 'safe' DOL injection start (no DOL expansion needed)
0x800034AC | DOL Direct : 0x4AC
end:
0x800053E0 | DOL Direct : 0x23E0

Thanks gamemasterplc for informing me about the unused interrupt vectors for the target resident kernel!
