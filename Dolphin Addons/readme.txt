Merge the `Load` folder with Dolphin's User Folder. On Dolphin's menu bar, click `File` -> `Open User Folder` to find it.

Enable Textures under Dolphin's "Graphics/Advanced/Load Custom Textures" (Prefetch Custom Textures recommended too)
and Enable Bloom Scaling with "Graphics/Advanced/Enable Graphics Mods"

Right click the game in the list -> Properties -> Choose the Graphics Mods tab and check the "Native Resolution Bloom" option
This will reduce Bloom offset issues, though to get perfect bloom offset you must disable "Graphics/Hacks/Vertex Rounding"
You will notice a 1px width bar on the edge of the screen that bleeds colors, but bloom will be properly offset (only at odd resolutions at this time, ex 3x, 5x, 7x...)
