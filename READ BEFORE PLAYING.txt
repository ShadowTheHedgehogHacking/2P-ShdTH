- Chunks Fix currently causes crashes if players are too far away.
	This is especially present on The Doom / GUN Fortress / Central City
	Stay within reasonable range to not crash.
- Air-vents/Air Blower bug - either player may get stuck in the animation.
	Use Chaos Blast to break out of the animation. (either player Z+L to fill meter)
- Checkpoint backtracking does not work
- Some vehicles and turrets mess up the camera of P1 if P2 uses it
- Z+L is Chaos Blast Activator, Z+R is Chaos Control Activator, Z+L+R is Clear Chaos Powers
- Change characters:
	Select 2P-VS, select characters, back out to the main menu at the 1-3 round select screen. Your character choices will carry over to 2P CO-OP.
