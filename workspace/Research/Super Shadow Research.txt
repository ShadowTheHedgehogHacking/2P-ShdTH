super loading model:
80086ec0: loads status bit(0xAC) 40000000


reads(0xAC):
800b5240
<deleted rest as lead to nothing>

8027f088 changes to 0x00000010
80079378 changes to 0xc0000000
8027f144 changes to 0x00080000

--this doesnt work, new approach---

----------------

80099f78 -> magic happens in here, nop the next check for always super
---not quite, isnt always called

800af8b8 -> the next step out, bctrl, appears to call multiple things
-without gecko code enabled the following are ctrl destinations:
	-801dbae4
	-80099898
	-80099a50
	-80099658
-with gecko code enabled
	-801dbae4
	-80099898
	-80099a50
	-80099658
	-80099f1c******** <- this one?
	
for the bctrl above, code goes like this:
	lwz r12, 0(r31);
	lwz r12, 0xC(r12);
	mtctr r12;
	bctrl;

(r12)801dbae4 originates from (r31)80992a00, which when dereferenced equates to string: "ClrVelocityCommand"
(r12)80099898 originates from (r31)809e5120, which when dereferenced equates to string: "Player::ResetCameraCommand"
(r12)80099a50 originates from (r31)809e5160, which when dereferenced equates to string: "Player::CancelActingCommand"
(r12)80099658 originates from (r31)809e51a0, which when dereferenced equates to string: "Player::ResetCommand"
(r12)80099f1c originates from (r31)809e51a0, which when dereferenced equates to string: "Player::ToSuperCommand"

80099f1c contains 80099f78 so.... partial success. now to find out why ToSuperCommand is called

801a0480 a few steps out, might be main function caller?
sets position, angle, super etc on restart. confirmed working as nopping makes it not happen
looking for player pointer

unrelated maybe:
800af6b8 bctrl called when player hit, followed by a beq. nopping beq causes death every hit, even for super


8027e184 stw  r0, 0x74 (r3) -> nopping this prevents the super "effect" pointer from being set to null, and keeps the super model, even though shadow is no longer "super"

after doing a write bp on the pointer to super effect, 8004eed4 appears to set it to 0 as follows:
8004ef64 stw  r0, 0xC (r3)

stepping out to the previous function 8027e1e0, the top of which sets 0x18(r30) to 8054defc, which appears to be a proper pointer to Player::Shadow::Super
never seen this "object" before, might be related

turns out the pointer to the "super effect" only makes regular shadow invisible, thus not quite what im after

going back to 8027e184 to see why 0x74(r3) being set to 2 causes super model to dissapear, and shadow to reappear
so actually after setting the pointer to "Super"(playerpointer->0x23c->0x44) to null it looks like it detaches super shadows model from shadow
so this probably is related to creating/destroying the model, but will likely be in a differnet function

for potential 2p shadow: 80099f48 changes the stack in some way to put the player pointer at 0x20(sp), investigate
...
actually its just r4 that contains player pointer
