## Source code for the mod / process

`dreamsyntax-notes.txt` was not intended for others.
Contains addresses I (dreamsyntax) found that are interesting and my process (if you can follow my notes).
As time went on the notes got more consistent/better and are more readable.

`GUPE8P.map` is our latest self-defined symbols for Shadow The Hedgehog (US).

The `*.dmw` files are memory list files for Shadow The Hedgehog (US), which can be opened with [aldelaro5's Dolphin Memory Engine](https://github.com/aldelaro5/Dolphin-memory-engine)

Other misc files may be brief codes or descriptions used while trying to understand the game
