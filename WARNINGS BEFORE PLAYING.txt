- Air-vents/Air Blower bug - either player may get stuck in the animation.
     Use Chaos Blast to break out of the animation. (either player Z+L to fill meter)
- Chunks are based on P1 only - stay near each other
- Checkpoint backtracking does not work
- For flying sections, P2 must mount first
- For Warpholes, follow Warp Warning
- Some vehicles and turrets mess up the camera of P1 if P2 uses it
- Z+L is Chaos Blast Activator, Z+R is Chaos Control Activator
     If you decide to use Chaos Control (or have to, like in The Last Way), first press Z+R to activate chaos control state for P1 and P2.
- Change characters:
     Select 2P-VS, select characters, back out to the main menu at the 1-3 round select screen. Your character choices will carry over to 2P CO-OP.
