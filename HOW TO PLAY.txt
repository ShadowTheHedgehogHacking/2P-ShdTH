=== Release 4 / v1.2 - 2019.03.03 ===

Please verify you are using a 1:1 ShadowTheHedgehog USA ISO: md5: fc936c9b0144c925b45b805fd39da2ac

To play this mod, you must:
(1) copy over the files in 'files' onto the root of the ShadowTheHedgehog.iso
(2) enable Gecko codes and use provided GCT (Wii/Nintendont) or game config .ini (Dolphin)

You can find a setup tutorial video at: https://youtube.com/dreamsyntax

=== Extracting and Rebuilding ISO with Modification ===
    Open gcr.exe (GameCube Rebuilder)
    Select "Image -> Open" on the menubar
    Select your ShadowTheHedgehog ISO
    On the right side of GCR is the Structure pane. Right click "root" (with the disc icon) and select "Export..."
    Extract to a new temporary folder of your choice
      Note the progress bar on the bottom - the program will make a brief chime and a popup will say "Done"
    Select "Image -> Close" on the menubar
    Outside of GCR, copy over the contents of the release zips "files" folder into "<yourtempfolder>/root
      Not the 'files' folder itself, the files inside of it. You should be prompted to overwrite, say yes
    Back in GCR, Select "Root -> Open..." on the menubar
    Select <yourtempfolder>/root
    Select "Root -> Save..." on the menubar
    Browse to a directory you want the modified ISO to be built 
       If using Nintendont, you want: "SD:/games/Shadow The Hedgehog [GUPE8P]/game.iso" (or USB:/games...etc)
       If using Dolphin, you can name the ISO anything
    Select "Root -> Rebuild" on the menubar
      Note the progress bar on the bottom- the program will make a brief chime and a popup will say "Done"

=== Nintendont / Wii Setup ===
    **This assumes you are familiar with Nintendont**
      If not, I recommend a quick read here:
        https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont
    You do NOT need kenobiwii.bin! 

    Tested with Build v5.485 - Aug 26 2018 on a Wii
    Copy GUPE8P.gct to the same directory as your game.iso (doesnt matter if its USB or SD)
       e.g. USB:/games/Shadow The Hedgehog [GUPE8P] should have:
                               game.iso
                               GUPE8P.gct
            in the folder.
    Copy 'saves' folder to root of USB or SD (same one where game is)
    Nintendont should be configured as follows for the best experience:
        Cheats ON
        Force Widescreen OFF (ensure its not ON!) 
        Unlock Read Speed ON
		
    Optional:
       	Memcard Emulation ON (if you don't have a memcard with stages unlocked already)
	Force Progressive ON (prevents video mode change at start, use if you are on component/hdmi)
        Video Width (Set to whatever fills your screen if you want the same aspect as Dolphin, in my case it was 714)

=== Dolphin Setup ===
The easiest way to do this is with the packaged PreConfigured-Dolphin

Clockspeed is set to 165% by default. Performance varies widely by system
If performance is bad dial clockspeed back to 100%, then slowly raising it (see "For performance issues" below)
Some testers reported 100% worked best for them, others 120%, with the majority being 165%

    Open Dolphin
    Select Config
    Select Paths Tab
    Select "Add" for Game Folders
    Navigate to the folder with the newly built ISO
    Configure Controllers
    Play!

For performance issues adjust clockspeed while running the game (Dolphin has a bug with this where your change may not save on restart. Try checking the clockspeed adjustment setting on/off twice):
    Select Config
    Select Advanced Tab
    Adjust CPU Clock Override slider


Enjoy!
