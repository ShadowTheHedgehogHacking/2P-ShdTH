							2 Player Shadow The Hedgehog

=== Release 6 / v2.1 - 2020.09.09 ===

- Change characters:
	Select 2P-VS, select characters, back out to the main menu at the 1-3 round select screen. Your character choices will carry over to 2P CO-OP.

=== Setup ===
Please verify you are using a 1:1 ShadowTheHedgehog USA ISO: md5: fc936c9b0144c925b45b805fd39da2ac

To play this mod, you must:
(1) replace the main.dol over 'sys' and overwrite any files in 'files' from the ISO_EDITS folder in the repo.
(2) enable Gecko codes and use provided game config .ini (Dolphin)
(3) Optimize Dolphin! It's worth it, see below

You can find a setup tutorial video by searching for "Shadow 2P Mod - How To Setup by dreamsyntax" on YouTube

=== Extracting and Rebuilding ISO ===

If you are having problems, make sure its the USA version of the game.

(Windows only)
1. Copy GUPE8P.iso to ISOPatch folder
2. Open nod_extract.bat
3. Copy and overwrite files in nodEXT from the "ISO_EDITS"
4. Make any additional file changes if you want (Char models etc)
5. Open nod_build.bat
-> Use the newly generated 2P-ShdTH-9-9-2020.iso

OR

Use cmd/powershell and do the following.
1. Use bundled nod_tool and extract the iso with:
	.\nodtool-2020-05-31.exe extract .\GUPE8P.iso nodEXT
then overwrite files from ISO_EDITS onto nodEXT

1.5 If you want to change anything here (change character models etc, do it before you build your ISO in the next step)

2. Use bundled nod_tool to rebuild a new iso with:
	.\nodtool-2020-05-31.exe makegcn .\nodEXT\ 2P-ShdTH-9-9-2020.iso
	
Your new ISO is now made!
----------------------------

If this is too confusing: an xdelta3 patch is available, but its 417MB for some unknown reason we could not figure out. xdelta 1 (for linux) produces a 3mb file
but for some reason xdelta3 produces a huge file, sometimes 1GB! This is as small as I could get it where windows/mac/linux could properly generate the modded iso.

You can download it here:
https://mega.nz/file/zbQjyKjK#RA2EkFWuXQf2NFRPvpSQdTec7DklLBFfwOGaFx7r1pc
OR (Mirror): 
https://www.mediafire.com/file/pw3r5fe6eb3r7gj/2P-ShdTH-2.1-ISO_Patcher.rar/file

Follow the README.txt to build the ISO on Windows/Mac/Linux.

DO NOT USE GCR! GCR causes problems with the extended DOL.
Dolphin Extracted Format / FST IS NOT Recommended! Has a higher rate of crashing for this mod and game in general.


=== Dolphin Setup ===
DO NOT USE 5.0 STABLE! Use 5.0-10912 or newer! 
  There are tons of performance fixes that directly impact this game
  You can download the latest Dolphin here: https://dolphin-emu.org/download/
  Be sure to install the pre-req of "64-bit Visual C++ redistributable for Visual Studio 2019" linked at the top of Dolphin download page

0. GUPE8P.ini needs to be moved/copied to your Documents\Dolphin Emulator\GameSettings\ folder
	OR if you are in portable mode (add portable.txt to Dolphin dir to enable) this folder instead will be in "<Dolphin.exe Directory>\User\GameSettings\"

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT FORGET THIS STEP ABOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	Open Dolphin
1. Add Game to Dolphin
    Select Config
    Select Paths Tab
    Select "Add" for Game Folders
    Navigate to the folder with the newly built ISO
2. Best Performance Configuration
Select Graphics
	Under General:
		Set Backend to Direct3D 11 or Vulkan (as of 5.0-10912 Direct3D 12 can cause crashes for 2P-ShdTH)
		Set Aspect Ratio to Force 16:9 or Stretch to Window
	Under Enhancements:
		I recommend 3x Native if on a 1080p monitor, settings here are optional. If you are on a low end PC leave as 1x Native.
	Under Hacks:
		Check/Enable everything (big performance gain)
	Under Advanced:
		Check/Enable Load Custom Textures and Prefetch Custom Textures

2.5. SD Texture Pack
	https://mega.nz/file/vO50lSwT#CCB2iqM-bvullTHaORTLTSEvvHpPVGoD6InZjEuTFQU
	Download the latest SD Texture Pack (mentioned on the releases page where you downloaded this) and unpack to
		Dolphin\User\Load\Textures
	This is optional but will restore the original game textures rather than the highly crunched versions required to not crash

3. Configure Controllers
4. Play!
5. FPS optimization (CPU variable):
	Adjust clockspeed while running the game (Note: Dolphin only saves this change for next run if your game is NOT running; You should find the value that runs best then close the game, set it again and it will stay there):
    
	It varies per system, some run better with underclock/overclock
	
	I recommend trying 80%, 120%, 165%, 189%, 217%, 230%, 287% 
	Note that higher clockspeeds may result in audio distortions, if it occurs lower the clockspeed.
	I run 217% on an AMD Ryzen 7 3800X, and ran 165% on a Intel i5-3570k with both having great FPS for most levels
How?:
	Select Config
    Select Advanced Tab
    Adjust CPU Clock Override slider

I recommend loading in Glyphic Canyon, have one player stay at the start and the other go to the first area with enemies and Knuckles.
Try adjusting the slider here to reach 60fps. (It will be ~30fps before adjustments)

6. Gecko customization:
	Right click the game and choose Properties
	Choose the Gecko Codes tab
	Here you can enable/disable some of the codes used in the mod. The rest are embedded in the dol and are not able to be disabled.
Enjoy!
