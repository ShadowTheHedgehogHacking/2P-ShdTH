									Bring you
							2 Player Shadow The Hedgehog

=== Release 6 / v2.1 - 2020.0X.0X ===

- Change characters:
	Select 2P-VS, select characters, back out to the main menu at the 1-3 round select screen. Your character choices will carry over to 2P CO-OP.

=== Setup ===
Please verify you are using a 1:1 ShadowTheHedgehog USA ISO: md5: fc936c9b0144c925b45b805fd39da2ac

To play this mod, you must:
(1) copy over the files in 'files' onto the root of the ShadowTheHedgehog.iso
(2) enable Gecko codes and use provided GCT (Wii/Nintendont) or game config .ini (Dolphin)

You can find a setup tutorial video by searching for "Shadow 2P Mod - How To Setup by dreamsyntax" on YouTube

=== Extracting and Rebuilding ISO ===
<Rewrite steps to use NOD instead of GCR or just xdelta>

=== Nintendont / Wii Setup ===
    **This assumes you are familiar with Nintendont**
      If not, I recommend a quick read here:
        https://github.com/FIX94/Nintendont
    You do NOT need kenobiwii.bin! 

    Tested with XXXX on a Wii
    Copy GUPE8P.gct to the same directory as your game.iso (doesnt matter if its USB or SD)
       e.g. USB:/games/Shadow The Hedgehog [GUPE8P] should have:
                               game.iso
                               GUPE8P.gct
            in the folder.
    Copy 'saves' folder to root of USB or SD (same one where game is)
    Nintendont should be configured as follows for the best experience:
        Cheats ON
        Force Widescreen OFF (ensure its not ON!) 
        Unlock Read Speed ON
		
    Optional:
       	Memcard Emulation ON (if you don't have a memcard with stages unlocked already)
        Video Width (Set to whatever fills your screen if you want the same aspect as Dolphin, in my case it was 714)

=== Dolphin Setup ===
DO NOT USE 5.0 STABLE! Use 5.0-10912 or newer! 
  There are tons of performance fixes that directly impact this game
  You can download the latest Dolphin here: https://dolphin-emu.org/download/
  Be sure to install the pre-req of "64-bit Visual C++ redistributable for Visual Studio 2019" linked at the top of Dolphin download page

0. GUPE8P.ini needs to be moved/copied to your Documents\Dolphin Emulator\GameSettings\ folder
	OR if you are in portable mode (add portable.txt to Dolphin dir to enable) this folder instead will be in "<Dolphin.exe Directory>\User\GameSettings\"

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT FORGET THIS STEP ABOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	Open Dolphin
1. Add Game to Dolphin
    Select Config
    Select Paths Tab
    Select "Add" for Game Folders
    Navigate to the folder with the newly built ISO
2. Best Performance Configuration
Select Graphics
	Under General:
		Set Backend to Direct3D 11 or Vulkan (as of 5.0-10912 Direct3D 12 can cause crashes for 2P-ShdTH)
		Set Aspect Ratio to Force 16:9 or Stretch to Window
	Under Enhancements:
		I recommend 3x Native if on a 1080p monitor, other settings here are optional
	Under Hacks:
		Check/Enable everything
	Under Advanced:
		Check/Enable Load Custom Textures and Prefetch Custom Textures

2.5. SD Texture Pack
	Download the latest SD Texture Pack (mentioned on the releases page where you downloaded this) and unpack to
		Dolphin\User\Load\Textures
	This is optional but will restore the original game textures rather than the highly crunched versions required to not crash

3. Configure Controllers
4. Play!
5. FPS optimization (CPU variable):
	Adjust clockspeed while running the game (Note: Dolphin only saves this change for next run if your game is NOT running; You should find the value that runs best then close the game, set it again and it will stay there):
    
	It varies per system, some run better with underclock/overclock
	
	I recommend trying 80%, 120%, 165%, 189%, 217%, 230%, 287% 
	Note that higher clockspeeds may result in audio distortions, if it occurs lower the clockspeed.
	I run 217% on an AMD Ryzen 7 3800X, and ran 165% on a Intel i5-3570k with both having great FPS for most levels
How?:
	Select Config
    Select Advanced Tab
    Adjust CPU Clock Override slider

I recommend loading in Glyphic Canyon, have one player stay at the start and the other go to the first area with enemies and Knuckles.
Try adjusting the slider here to reach 60fps. (It will be ~30fps before adjustments)

6. Gecko customization:
	Right click the game and choose Properties
	Choose the Gecko Codes tab
	Here you can enable/disable some of the codes used in the mod. The rest are embedded in the dol and are not able to be disabled.
Enjoy!
